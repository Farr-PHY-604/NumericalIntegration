# Numerical Integration Class (Live Coding)

The code in the notebook in this repository is in Julia.  To try it out
yourself, install Julia on your computer, enter the top level directory (where
this file is), start Julia, and issue the command

    using Pkg
    Pkg.activate(".")

That should install all the necessary libraries associated with this package.
From there, you can start up an IJulia notebook via

    using IJulia
    notebook(dir=pwd())

which will start up a Jupyter notebook server in the current directory, from
which you can load the Integration.ipynb notebook that we worked on in class
today.  Please play around!
